# Divide By Zero?
# What happens if you divide by zero in Python? Try it out! Test run this code and see what happens.
print(5 / 0)

# Traceback means "What was the programming doing when it broke"! This part is usually less helpful than the very last line of your error. Though you can dig through the rest of the error, looking at just the final line ZeroDivisionError, and the message says we divided by zero. Python is enforcing the rules of arithmetic!
# 
# In general, there are two types of errors to look out for
# 
# Exceptions
# Syntax
# An Exception is a problem that occurs when the code is running, but a 'Syntax Error' is a problem detected when Python checks the code before it runs it. For more information
